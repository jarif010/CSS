        <h2>Basic info about dogs</h2>
        <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
         Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene
         wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
         Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers
         over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.</p>

        <h2>Fun facts about dogs</h2>
        <p>Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time.
             Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of 
             time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read
             clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much,
             but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs
             are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught 
             to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs 
             are the perfect example of this.</p>
